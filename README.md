This repository is about board game "Nine Men's Morris" with logic implementation**.

- **Detailed Explanation**:
  - Implements a **full board game simulation** for **Nine Men's Morris**.
  - Utilizes **graph-based adjacency lists** to manage board movements.
  - Includes **game state management** with saving and loading functionality.
  - Handles **player interactions** with turn-based logic and move validation.
  - Implements **winning conditions**, restricting movement when necessary.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Board Representation & Display**:
    - `draw_board(g)`: Displays the game board using ASCII art with colored pieces.
    - `is_adjacent(i, j)`: Checks if two positions on the board are adjacent.
  - **Game Logic & Moves**:
    - `new_game()`: Initializes a fresh game state.
    - `remaining_counters(g)`: Determines the number of pieces each player has left.
    - `place_counter(g, i)`: Places a counter for the active player on the board.
    - `move_counter(g, i, j)`: Moves a counter to an adjacent valid position.
    - `remove_opponent_counter(g, i)`: Allows a player to remove an opponent's piece if a mill is formed.
  - **Game State Management**:
    - `save_state(g, filename)`: Saves the current game state to a file.
    - `load_state(filename)`: Loads a previously saved game state.
  - **Gameplay Flow**:
    - `play_game()`: Runs the full game loop, handling turns, board updates, and win conditions.
    - Players must place pieces, move them strategically, and block their opponent while aiming to reduce the opponentâ€™s counters.
    - If a player is left with only two pieces or has no valid moves left, they lose the game.

## How to Run
1. **Install Python** (if not already installed).
2. **Run a specific coursework file**:
   ```bash
   python coursework1.py
   python coursework2.py
   python coursework_3.py
   ```
3. **Follow on-screen prompts for interactive functionality**.

## Summary of Learning Outcomes
- **Mathematical Programming**: Implemented numerical computations and algorithms.
- **Card Game Simulation**: Developed logic for deck creation, shuffling, and dealing.
- **Board Game Implementation**: Created a functional **Nine Men's Morris** game with interactive play and game state persistence.
